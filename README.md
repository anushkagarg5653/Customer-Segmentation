# Customer-Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the process of separating your customers into groups based on what certain traits (e.g. personality, interests, habits) and factors (e.g. demographics, industry, income) they share.

# Importance of Customer Segmentation
Since the marketerâ€™s goal is usually to maximize the value (revenue and/or profit) from each customer, it is critical to know in advance how any particular marketing action will influence the customer.Using the large amount of data available on customers (and potential customers), a customer segmentation analysis allows marketers to identify discrete groups of customers with a high degree of accuracy based on demographic, behavioral and other indicators.
